# Belly Button Biodiversity

In this challenge we created a website that provides data about bacteria in people's belly buttons. The information is presented with 3 charts. One is a horizontal barchart of the top 10 bacteria cultrues found in a sample, a bubble chart that shows the amount and type of bacteria cultures in a sample, and the gauge chart shows the belly button washing frequency for the sample. When first opening the website, the charts are populated with sample number 940 sample data. On the left hand side there is an option to choose the sample of data. Each sample represents a different person's data. Since this is data from research, people that participated in this research can go to this website and look at their own bacteria data as well as other people's data. A person would know their own id and therefore know which data is describing their own belly button.
